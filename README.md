# EmoStream-Concurrent-Emoji-Broadcast-over-Event-Driven-Architecture

Developed a horizontally scalable, event-driven system to capture and broadcast thousands of usergenerated emojis in real time, enhancing viewer interaction on live-stream platforms. Implemented Kafka for
data streaming and Spark for real-time processing, ensuring high concurrency and low latency.
